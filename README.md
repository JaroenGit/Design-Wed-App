Applying the Process of Converting UX/UI Designs into a Functional Website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

‚úÖ 1. Introduction
~~~
In the present era, User Experience (UX) design and User Interface (UI) design play a significant role in website
and application development. High-quality UX/UI design improves usability and enhances user satisfaction. However,
transforming such designs into an actual functional website requires appropriate processes and technologies.
This study focuses on applying UX/UI designs to develop a functional website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The goal is to create a system that supports multiple screen sizes (Responsive Design) while maintaining the structure
and style consistent with the original design.

     - Landing / Home Page: Showcasing products, services, and promotions.
     - Category / Product Listing Page: Displaying product lists in a grid format.
     - Product Details Page: Showing detailed product information.
     - Cart / Checkout Page: Summarizing products, providing input fields for shipping details, and payment options.
 3) Responsive Design Implementation
     Utilize the Bootstrap Grid System to adjust layouts automatically according to different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
